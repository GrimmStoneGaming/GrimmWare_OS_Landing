       GrimmWare OS isn’t just sound—

      it’s a system.

     <p>

        “I See It All”
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They look to me when the sky turns black
       <br/>
       When the walls cave in, I hold them back
       <br/>
       I try so hard to keep the evil at bay,
       <br/>
       To keep them from seeing me give way
       <br/>
       I'm breaking beneath what they’ll never know
       <br/>
       But I'm the one protecting - I can never let it show
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the storm behind your eyes
       <br/>
       The sleepless nights you try to disguise
       <br/>
       You don’t have to bleed alone tonight
       <br/>
       Just reach out to me and let me help you fight
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gotta hold up their world so they don’t fall
       <br/>
       I won't watch you be crushed beneath it all
       <br/>
       I can never let go, or it'll all be lost
       <br/>
       I'll help carry it all, no matter what the cost
       <br/>
       If I fall apart now, it'll all come down
       <br/>
       Then I'll be there to help you before you drown
      </p>
      <p>
       You scream out in silence, but drown in the noise
       <br/>
       Give away your soul like you’ve got no choice
       <br/>
       They praise the light but miss the flame
       <br/>
       That’s burning you down just to keep them sane
       <br/>
       You ache in places no one sees
       <br/>
       But I can feel the tremble in your knees
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t afford to fall apart
       <br/>
       This is how I guard all your hearts
       <br/>
       But in the silence I admit my fear
       <br/>
       Being forgotten just for being sincere
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gotta hold up their world so they don’t fall
       <br/>
       I won't watch you be crushed beneath it all
       <br/>
       I can never let go, or it'll all be lost
       <br/>
       I'll help carry it all, no matter what the cost
       <br/>
       If I fall apart now, it'll all come down
       <br/>
       Then I'll be there to help you before you drown
      </p>
      <p>
       You think your pain makes you weak, but that's a lie
       <br/>
       But what if I stop and they all ask why?
       <br/>
       Then let them see all the cracks you hide
       <br/>
       But what if I should fall?
       <br/>
       Then I’ll be by your side!
      </p>
      <p>
       I gotta hold up their world so they don’t fall
       <br/>
       I won't watch you be crushed beneath it all
       <br/>
       I can never let go, or it'll all be lost
       <br/>
       I'll help carry it all, no matter what the cost
       <br/>
       I feel broken inside, but I still stand tall
       <br/>
       I promise you're not alone... I see it all...
