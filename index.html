        <h2>What is <strong class="red">GrimmWare OS</strong>?</h2>
        <p><strong>GrimmWare OS isn’t just sound—</strong> it’s a system.</p>
        <p>It’s music engineered from <span class="cyan">raw emotion</span>, forged with <span class="red">pain</span>, <span class="pink">scars</span>, and powered by <span class="blue">pure creativity</span>.</p>
        <p>I don’t chase trends—I craft <span class="blue">code-driven chaos</span> and <span class="blue">purpose-built passion</span>.</p>
        <p>From glitchy synths to guttural screams, every track pulses with intent—designed to hit you where it <span class="red">hurts</span>… or <span class="blue">heals</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="pink"><span class="red">This is music as emotional malware.</span></span></p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p><span style="color: #ffb84d; font-weight: bold;">Why does it exist?</span></p>
        <p>Because art doesn’t begin and end with a six-string or a set of lungs.<br>Because creativity isn’t defined by your tools—only by your truth.</p>
        <p><span class="red">GrimmWare OS</span> was <span style="color: #ffb84d; font-weight: bold;">born from rebellion</span>, sculpted in silence, and lit on fire by creators who got tired of asking permission to feel something.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p>I don’t use AI to skip the work—I use it to <span class="blue">dig deeper</span>. I generate. I reshape. I rebuild.<br>And what comes out the other side? That’s <strong>me</strong>—in executable form.</p>
        <p>To anyone scared to show what they’ve made because of judgment—<span class="cyan">you’re not alone</span>.<br>We’ve bled into our machines and made art from the aftermath.</p>
        <p>They can call it cheating all they want.<br><span class="red">Let ‘em.</span><br>We’ll still be over here—<span class="blue">rewriting the definition of creative warfare.</span></p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p><span class="red">The hammer never swung itself.</span><br>But we sure as hell did.</p>

        <div class="spacer"></div>

        <p><span class="pink">This is the uprising.</span><br><span class="red">This is GrimmWare OS.</span><br><span class="cyan">Run it.</span></p>

        <p><strong>“I See It All”</strong></p>

        <p>They look to me when the sky turns black<br>
        When the walls cave in, I hold them back<br>
        I try so hard to keep the evil at bay,<br>
        To keep them from seeing me give way<br>
        I'm breaking beneath what they’ll never know<br>
        But I'm the one protecting - I can never let it show</p>

        <p>I see the storm behind your eyes<br>
        The sleepless nights you try to disguise<br>
        You don’t have to bleed alone tonight<br>
        Just reach out to me and let me help you fight</p>

        <p>I've gotta hold up their world so they don’t fall<br>
        I won't watch you be crushed beneath it all<br>
        I can never let go, or it'll all be lost<br>
        I'll help carry it all, no matter what the cost<br>
        If I fall apart now, it'll all come down<br>
        Then I'll be there to help you before you drown</p>

        <p>You scream out in silence, but drown in the noise<br>
        Give away your soul like you’ve got no choice<br>
        They praise the light but miss the flame<br>
        That’s burning you down just to keep them sane<br>
        You ache in places no one sees<br>
        But I can feel the tremble in your knees</p>

        <p>I can’t afford to fall apart<br>
        This is how I guard all your hearts<br>
        But in the silence I admit my fear<br>
        Being forgotten just for being sincere</p>

        <p>I've gotta hold up their world so they don’t fall<br>
        I won't watch you be crushed beneath it all<br>
        I can never let go, or it'll all be lost<br>
        I'll help carry it all, no matter what the cost<br>
        If I fall apart now, it'll all come down<br>
        Then I'll be there to help you before you drown</p>

        <p>You think your pain makes you weak, but that's a lie<br>
        But what if I stop and they all ask why?<br>
        Then let them see all the cracks you hide<br>
        But what if I should fall?<br>
        Then I’ll be by your side!</p>

        <p>I gotta hold up their world so they don’t fall<br>
        I won't watch you be crushed beneath it all<br>
        I can never let go, or it'll all be lost<br>
        I'll help carry it all, no matter what the cost<br>
        I feel broken inside, but I still stand tall<br>
        I promise you're not alone... I see it all...</p>
